# Contributing to code
* Make sure that your modifications do not result in loss of the necessary coverage defined in the PvXwiki Build Packs project: https://gwpvx.gamepedia.com/PvXwiki:Build_Packs
* Clearly describe your intended changes in comments and pull requests.
* Avoid any changes that would result in visiting a build page more than once (except for retrying a failed page, within reason).

# Submitting errors
* Include all settings used when you encountered the issue. If your issue involves only the essentials version (which only has default settings), mention that.
* If you used the logfile parameter, attach the logfile for that run to your issue.
* Describe as clearly as possible what was wrong with the script output. Some things that should be included:
  * Specific builds that are missing or in wrong packs
  * Specific builds saved with invalid codes
  * Any misnamed files, folders, or zips
* You can submit issues here regarding the packs that are hosted at https://app.box.com/s/nouafcz6bx.
* This script is intended to only be used with https://gwpvx.gamepedia.com/PvX_wiki. There are no plans to support the wikia branch of PvXwiki, though the script will probably work on it.

# Submitting suggestions
* Suggestions for improving the script or adding new types of packs are welcome!
* If you want to see specific packs curated and uploaded to the box account that aren't already available, please provide a brief justification for them.
